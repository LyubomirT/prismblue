# Contributing to PrismBlue

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PrismBlue! We welcome all contributions, whether they are bug fixes, feature requests, or anything else. Please read the following guidelines before contributing.

## TL;DR
1. **Fork** the repo, don't branch.
2. **Test** your code before submitting a pull request.
3. **AI assistance** is allowed, but AIs doing everything is not.
4. **Compare** your changes with the main repo before submitting.

## Detailed Guidelines

### 1. Fork the Repository
We prefer that you fork the repository rather than creating branches. This makes it easier for you to work on your own version of the codebase. Once you have made your changes, you can submit a pull request.

### 2. Test Your Code
It's essential that you test your code before you submit it. This helps maintain the quality of PrismBlue and reduces the chances of introducing bugs. Please provide evidence of your tests in your pull request.

### 3. AI Assistance
We welcome the use of AI for assistance in coding, such as suggesting code snippets or optimizing code. However, we prohibit the use of AI to write all the code on behalf of the contributor. We believe in the value of human creativity and ingenuity.

### 4. Compare Your Changes
Before submitting your pull request, please compare your changes with the main repository. This helps to resolve any conflicts and ensures that your changes align with the current state of the project.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Once you have followed the above steps, you are ready to submit a pull request. We appreciate your contribution and will review it as soon as possible.
